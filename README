NAME
    Perl::Critic::logicLAB - Perl::Critic policies implemented and used by
    logicLAB

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.09

SYNOPSIS
        % perlcritic --theme logiclab

DESCRIPTION
    Perl::Critic::logicLAB is not a distribution of policies, it is more of
    a meta-package, implemented like the Task distributions.

    This is not the recommended way of doing things, but it does offer the
    following benefits:

    *   Policies can be released separately

    *   Policies can be released without association with
        Perl::Critic::logicLAB until their value and correctness has been
        asserted

    *   You can write a meta-package, listing the policies you want on a
        policy by policy level, using the same schema

POLICIES
    *   Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::ProhibitShellDispatch

    *   Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::ProhibitUseLib

    *   Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::RequireSheBang

    *   Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::RequireVersionFormat

    *   Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::RequirePackageNamePattern

    *   Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::RequireParamsValidate

    *   Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::ModuleBlacklist
