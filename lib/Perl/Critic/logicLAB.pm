=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::logicLAB - a set of Perl::Critic policies implemented and used by logicLAB

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    % perlcritic --theme logiclab

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl::Critic::logicLAB is not a distribution of policies, it is more of a
meta-package, implemented like the L<Task> distributions.

This is not the recommended way of doing things, but it does offer the following
benefits:

=over

=item * Policies can be released separately

=item * Policies can be released without association with Perl::Critic::logicLAB
until their value and correctness has been asserted

=item * You can write a meta-package, listing the policies you want on a policy
by policy level, using the same schema

=item * L<Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::ProhibitUseLib|Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::ProhibitUseLib>

=item * L<Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::RequireVersionFormat|Perl::Critic::Policy::logicLAB::RequireVersionFormat>
